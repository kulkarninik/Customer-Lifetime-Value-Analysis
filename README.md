# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis project. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict their lifetime value, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and optimize marketing strategies.

# Objectives

Visualize Customer Acquisition Cost Distribution: Analyze and create visualizations to understand how acquisition costs are distributed across the customer base.

Revenue Analysis: Create visualizations for the revenue generated by individual customers to identify trends and patterns.

Channel Profitability Comparison: Compare acquisition costs across various channels and determine the most and least profitable ones.

Channel Effectiveness Analysis: Evaluate which channels are the most and least effective at converting potential customers into paying customers.

Revenue by Channel: Calculate the total revenue generated by each channel and analyze which channels perform best and worst in terms of revenue generation.

ROI Calculation: Calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each channel to measure profitability and efficiency.

# Methodology

Data Collection: Collected and preprocessed customer acquisition and revenue data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored data trends and identified key metrics for analysis.

Visualization: Created detailed and intuitive visualizations to highlight insights.

ROI Analysis: Computed ROI for each acquisition channel using revenue and cost data.

Performance Comparison: Analyzed channels based on profitability and effectiveness metrics.

# Key Tools & Technologies

Python: Core programming language used for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

Plotly: Data visualization libraries.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
